# [3D CSS Buttons](https://github.com/FutureMedia/3D-CSS-buttons)

This small project contains some 3d buttons created without using any graphic elements. I tried to reproduce the graphic style of the buttons presented by Peter Orme at [Principles for Successful Button Design](http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/design-theory/principles-for-successful-button-design/). 

The PrefixFree script is used to create the css vendor extensions.
